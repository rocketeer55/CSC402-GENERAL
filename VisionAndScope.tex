\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background}
Ever-growing data sets are causing an unnecessary burden on data scientists and data analysts. As data sets are expanding, and the number of sources where these sets come from is increasing, it is becoming harder for professionals working on this data to find the information they need. Much of this work currently is done manually, and makes it very difficult for someone new coming into a data position at an existing company with a large data sets to start working productively.
\subsection{Business Opportunity}
Developing a new data classifier tool will remove many of the manual hardships involved with analyzing large, and often unorganized data sets. Instead of spending hours searching for the proper data classification a data analyst might be looking for, the new data classifier tool will allow for automated classification. This tool would allow recently hired data analysts who don't have experience with a company's complex data sets to do analysis quicker. Developing this data classifier as a web-based interface allows data scientists and data analysts to spend less time looking for the data, and more time providing useful insights and metrics to the company.
